# Notification Sound

For the notification sound, you can:

1. Download a free notification sound from:
   - https://notificationsounds.com/
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
   - https://freesound.org/

2. Or use this command to download a simple notification sound:
   curl -o frontend/public/sounds/notification.mp3 "https://notificationsounds.com/storage/sounds/file-sounds-1150-pristine.mp3"

3. Or record your own using Audacity or similar tool

The sound file should be named: notification.mp3
And placed in: frontend/public/sounds/

For now, the app will work without the sound file (it will just log an error to console).
